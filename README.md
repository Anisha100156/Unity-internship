# 🎓 Unity Internship Project

This is a project I developed showcasing a clean and interactive UI that allows the generation of a **Student ID Card** by filling out a dynamic form.  
I built this project using **React.js** on **Replit**, gaining in-depth knowledge of frontend development with **Tailwind CSS** and **UI/UX principles**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the problem statement
- Identify the target users of the platform
- Decide on UI components and a visually appealing color theme
- Add essential functionalities without compromising design

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** – Component-based frontend architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for modern UI
- **Framer Motion** – For subtle, smooth animations

---

## 🧩 Componentization

One of the core tasks was breaking the UI into reusable components, each with specific responsibilities. These include:

- **Card** – Displays the preview of the ID
- **Form** – Dynamic input fields to gather user data
- **Toggle Switch** – Controls options like dark/light mode or QR visibility
- **Button** – Triggers actions like generate, download, etc.

In each component, I effectively:

- Managed props and local state
- Ensured responsive behavior
- Added functional interactivity

## 🖼️ Image Upload with Preview

This feature allows users to:

- Upload an image and instantly preview it within a **circular frame**
- Modify or replace the image if needed before final submission

Implementing the real-time preview was a challenging yet rewarding experience, achieved by referring to official documentation and community articles.

## 🗂️ Local Image Storage & QR Code Generation

- Uploaded images are stored locally for seamless reuse
- A **QR Code** is generated dynamically based on user input
- The QR code can be **downloaded as an image**, enabling modern, tech-enhanced identification

## ✅ Key Takeaways

This project helped me strengthen my frontend skills, understand user-centric design, manage React state and props, and integrate media/file-based features into a live web app. It’s a practical step forward in building production-level UIs.
