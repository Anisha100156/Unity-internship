## Unity Internship Project
-This is a project that I have created which shows a clean and interactive UI that allows the generation of student Id card by filling up a dynamic form.I have created this project in Replic using ReactJs. I have got in depth knowledge in front end design by using TailwindCSS and user principles.
### Understand the Objectives
-What is the problem statement
-Getting to know about the target users of the website
-Deciding upon the UI components and the color theme
-How to add up the functionalities yet visually appealing
### Choosing Tech stack
-ReactJs for building the component architecture and layout
-Tailwind CSS to design the frontend
-Framer motion to add up the subtle animation
### Componentization
-The major task for me was to build up the components that are to be reused multiple times
Components are
-Cards
-Forms
-Switch
-Button
-Here i have managed the props, managed local state and worked upon the functionalities.
### Image upload with preview feature
-It was a challenging part to make the preview of the image 
-But by reading several articles and documentations I managed to implement the image preview part
-Here the users can see the image in preview which will aloow them to look at the image in circular frame and change them if not satisfactory
