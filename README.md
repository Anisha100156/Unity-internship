# Unity Internship Project
- This is a project that I have created which shows a clean and interactive UI that allows the generation of student Id card by filling up a dynamic form.
- I have created this project in Replic using ReactJs. I have got in depth knowledge in front end design by using TailwindCSS and user principles.

## Understand the Objectives
- What is the problem statement -Getting to know about the target users of the website -Deciding upon the UI components and the color theme
- How to add up the functionalities yet visually appealing

## Choosing Tech stack
- ReactJs for building the component architecture and layout.
- Tailwind CSS to design the frontend -Framer motion to add up the subtle animation.

## Componentization
- The major task for me was to build up the components that are to be reused multiple times
Components are 
- Cards
- Forms
- Switch
- Button
- Here i have managed the props, managed local state and worked upon the functionalities.

## Image upload with preview feature
- It was a challenging part to make the preview of the image 
- But by reading several articles and documentations I managed to implement the image preview part
- Here the users can see the image in preview which will aloow them to look at the image in circular frame and change them if not satisfactory 

## Worked upon the QR code and download feature
- A QR code is generated that maps the user data to be shown
- Also the Idcard can be downloaded and reused
## Template switch
- An important feature is to toggle between template design in terms of forms and also student ID card
- This will dynamically change the template layout and design
